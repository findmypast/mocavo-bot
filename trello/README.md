## MocavoBot: Trello
Run on a daily cron, this bot keeps our Trello board organized.

### Dependencies
This depends on a great Trello API wrapper library, found here:
https://github.com/cdaguerre/php-trello-api

To quote that project's readme, it's easiest to install the dependency with
Composer:

    $ composer require cdaguerre/php-trello-api:@dev

You also need a Trello API key - you can get that
[at Trello's developer site](https://trello.com/app-key).
